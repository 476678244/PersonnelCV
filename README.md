## Working Experience

#### Coupang, Supply Chain Management team
> Senior Software Engineer, 2016.11 ~ Current
- Projects: Core PO Automation (targeting for zero manual order) and fresh ordering(targeting for fresh business profitable). For these two ordering process, we implemented long term Inbound simulation to help doing better instock planning. We also had a decision tree model to analyse OOS and Scrap.
- My Role: I tuned performance of the core daily job, then reduced costing time from 30 minutes to within 5 minutes.  Basing on my refined code structure, time cost only twiced after data volume grew ten times.  I implemented the first version of inbound simulation using DP algorithm.  I worked with others to design OOS(Out of stock) analysis decision tree and independently designed Scrap analysis decision tree.  I developed a way to predict potiential oos and scrap in advance by using tensorflow to build convolutional nerual network.  I refined data input/output method using reflection and annotation to fix the pain point of file read/write unstable. 
- Skills: Spark, Redshift, Mongodb, Spring boot, Oozie, HDFS, S3, Airflow, Kafka, PySpark, Tensorflow Keras, Task Engine (A self innovated framework for managing spark job: can view, submit, monitor and kill spark job as a web server instead of oozie UI.)

#### Red, WMS team 
> Java Developer, 2016.9 ~ 2016.10
- Project Description: Develop Red`s WMS system from scratch.
- Skills: JSP, Spring, Mybatis


#### SAP Success Factors, Platform Service team 
> Software Engineer I -> II & New Employee Trainer, 2012.7 ~ 2016.9
- Projects: Role Based Permission, Dynamic Group Refreshing, Hana/Oracle Migration Tool, SAP Smart Express
- My Role: I started from intern role, working on writing unit test and improved test coverage to beyond 95%. Then I worked with global engineers to implement permission service as a platform to be integreted with different product team. There were existing one year, I am the single shanghai backend engineer facing to three QA members. I tuned the performance of dynamic group refreshing basing on existing code structure which is the pain point in business. After that, I worked with tech leader to implement next version of dynamic group refresh system. I learned from Hana Migration tool and developed my own Oracle Migration tool. I maintained a local Database and helped others to establish test environment on it. In part time, I worked with one architect and one UI engineer to implement SAP Express system which got SAP Smart Office Prize. 
- Skills: Jboss, Seam, Oracle, Hana, JProfiler

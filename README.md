Senior Backend Engineer in Coupang, core developer in team and focusing on supply chain process optimizing.

## Education

#### <span>Tongji University</span> <span>2009 ~ 2013</span>
- Bachelor`s Degree in Software Engineering
- CET6

## Skills

## Working Experience

#### Coupang, Supply Chain Management team
> Senior Software Engineer, 2016.11 ~ Current
- Projects: Core PO Automation (targeting for zero manual order) and Rocket Fresh Ordering(star project, targeting for fresh business profitable). We have a series of scientific models supporting these processes and we also implemented a long term Inbound simulation to help doing better instock planning. We also had a decision tree model to analyse OOS and Scrap.
- My Role: I tuned performance of core daily job, then reduced time consuming from 30 minutes to less than 5 minutes.  Basing on my refined code structure, time cost only doubled after data volume grew ten times.  I implemented the first version of long term inbound simulation using DP algorithm.  I worked with others to design OOS(Out of stock) analysis decision tree and independently designed Scrap analysis decision tree.  I developed a way to predict potential oos and scrap in advance by using tensorflow to build convolutional nerual network.  I refined data input/output method using reflection and annotation to fix the pain point of file unstable read/write function. I am also the bridge between engineering and data science. Once data scientist design a new model, I am able to implement it from engineer perspective.
- Skills: Spark, Redshift, Mongodb, Spring boot, Oozie, HDFS, S3, Kafka, PySpark, Tensorflow Keras, Task Engine (A self innovated framework for managing spark job: can view, submit, monitor and kill spark job as a web server instead of oozie UI.)

#### Red, WMS team 
> Java Developer, 2016.9 ~ 2016.10
- Projects: Develop Red`s WMS system from scratch.
- Skills: JSP, Spring, Mybatis


#### SAP Success Factors, Platform Service team 
> Software Engineer I -> II & New Employee Trainer, 2012.7 ~ 2016.9
- Projects: Role Based Permission, Dynamic Group Refreshing, Hana/Oracle Migration Tool, SAP Smart Express
- My Role: I started my career from intern role, working on unit test and improved test coverage to over 95%. Then I worked with global engineers to implement a role based permission service as a platform to be integrated with different product team. There existed a half and tough year, I was the single shanghai backend engineer facing to three QA members. I tuned performance of existing dynamic group refreshing logic which is the pain point in business. After that, I worked with tech leader to implement next version of refreshing system. I learned from Hana Migration tool and developed my own Oracle Migration tool. I maintained a local Database and helped others to establish their test environments. At part time, I worked with one architect and one UI engineer to implement SAP Express system which got SAP Smart Office Prize that year. 
- Skills: Jboss, Seam, Oracle, Hana, JProfiler
